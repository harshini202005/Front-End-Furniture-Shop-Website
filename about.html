            <p>In 2012, we started Comfy Furnitures with a vision - to make a million homes beautiful.
            Back then, our catalogue featured just 30 designs. Yet, when our customers shared
            photographs of their homes, 
            we saw they were remarkably distinct. The same table, the
            same chair was used differently by different people.
             This told us something. People
            want their homes to be unique.</p><br>
           Today, we understand that we’re here not just to sell well-designed products. We’re
            here to help you create <br>spaces that mirror who you are. At Comfy Furnitures, we want you
            to discover the joy of creating. We want you to think of the
            setting up of a space as an energizing, creative pursuit.<br>
